The script make-image.sh in this directory creates a modified Windows
install image from a standard one.  To use it, ensure that 7z and
xorrisofs are installed; on Debian systems they can be found in the
p7zip-full and xorriso packages respectively.

Run the script as:

    sh /path/to/make-image.sh <image.iso>

The result will be named kfwdev.iso in the current directory.  A
temporary directory named "workdir" will be created and removed.

The modified image takes care of the following aspects of creating a
development environment:

* Unattended Windows installation, configured to auto-logon to the
  built-in administrator account (the password is "kfw").

* Visual Studio 2022 installation.

* Chocolatey installation.  (We may eventually want to use winget, but
  there are several wrinkles: it does not appear to be present in a
  Windows 11 22h2 immediately, instead appearing after some time has
  passed; its git-bash install doesn't add shell programs to the path;
  dotnet's wix toolset install adds wix 4, which we haven't migrated
  to.)

* Strawberry Perl, git-bash, and emacs installation.

The following steps are not currently automated:

* Pinning the Visual Studio x86 and x64 command shells to the task
  bar.  Search for "x86" and "x64" in the start menu, then right-click
  each result and select the menu option to pin it.

* wix toolset installation ("choco install wixtoolset -y" and add to
  the search path as described at
  https://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Kerberos_for_Windows_(KfW)_Build_Environment
  ).  The dotnet dependency installation fails if run in an
  installation script.

* Cloning and configuring the krb5 repository.

* Adding ssh credentials.

* Installing any tools beneficial to the hypervisor, shch as VMWare
  Tools.

* Setting the desired display resolution.
